Design Patterns are not just about how you string objects together 
but also the intent thus most may almost technically do same thing but their 
intents are different

Eg proxy, decorator, adapter, facade are almost similar


IDisplay interface is not related to observer pattern in any way,it is
just to say that we have display methods to actually display 
updated info.
